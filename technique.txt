Coding can be a very long and sometimes complicated task. The assignments we are given are supposed to be
challenge and make us think. It may seem impossible at first, but with time, it does come together.
Our main programming technique is to start the assignment as soon as possible, give
yourself more than enough time to be able to fully complete the assignment. We decided to incorporate this
technique into our programming because it's importance was stressed at the start of the semester, and since
then, this technique has improved our overall time management.Time management is a very important skill that
you will have to learn; you are taking 3-5 classes a semester and as computer science students,
most of our work will take time. Waiting until the last minute to do a coding assignment will only
cause more stress. The feeling of have to code against the clock will only make you code worse. Having working,
easy to read and organized code will only help you in the long run.
Having more time to make sure your code is neat can only improve your learning and make you a better
programmer. When your assignment is complete, it is important to re-read the assignment to
make sure you hit every point and your assignment is 100% done. Hopefully since you started coding early
you're at 100% done a day or two before the assignment is due instead of it being 30 minutes before
the due date.
