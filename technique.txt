Coding is a very long and sometimes complicated task. The assignments we are given are supposed to be
challenging and make us think. It may seem impossible at first, but with time, it does come together.
Here are some of our recommendations; Start the assignment as soon as possible, give
yourself enough time to be able to complete the assignment completely. Now that you are about to start,
make sure you read the ENTIRE assignment before you start coding. Knowing what your code is expected to do
will help with the overall task of the assignment. Next think about different functions you might need
to be able to complete the task you are assigned. If all is failing, and you are stuck, no matter where in
the process, use your TA's. They are there to help you, your TA's will probably be your best friends
by the end of the semester. They are resourceful, helpful and very knowledgeable about the class you are in.
Now some advice you hear a lot is "compile early and often" and "write test cases first". The pieces of
advice are very helpful, so you don't have to look for small errors when there are hundreds of lines of code.
Writing test checks if your function is running as expected. A test case that passes means that the expected
output you gave the test worked. IF it fails there is a problem within the function, and you need to go back
and fix it. Test cases are very resourceful and worth your time. If you are doing paired programming, it is
very important to be on the same page. Working together at the same time is the vest way to work together.
One person being the driver (writing the code) and one person being the viewer and observing the coder.
It is important to stay locked in as the observer, becoming disjointed with the work is only the start
of a downward spiral that is hard to recover from. When your assignment is complete, it is important to
re-read the assignment one last time to make sure you hit very point and your assignment is 100% done.
