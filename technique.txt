Coding is a very long and sometimes complicated task. The assignments we are given are suppose to be
challenung and make us think. It may seem impposible at first, but with time, it does come together.
Here are some of our recomdations right off the bat. Start the assignment as soon as poosible, give
yourself enough time to be able to complete the assignment to full. Now that you are about to start,
make sure you read the ENTIRE assignemrnt before you start coding. Knowing what your code is expected to do, 
will help with the the overall task of the assignment. Next think about different functions you might need 
to be able to complete the task you are assigned. If all is failing and you are stuck, no matter where in 
the process, use your TA's. They are there to help you, your TA's will prabably be your bestfriends
by the end of the semester. The are resourceful, helpful and very knowledgeable about the clsss you are in.
Now some advice you hear a lot is "compile early and often" and "write test cases first". Thee pieces of
advice are very helpful, so you don't have to look for small erros when there are hundreds of lines of code.
Writing test checks if your function is running as expected. A test case that passes means that the expected
output you gave the test worked. IF it fails there is a probable within the function and you need to go back
and fix it. Test cases are very resourceful and worth your time. If you are doing paired proggramming, it is
very important to be on the same page. Working togther at the same time is the vest way to work togther.
One person being the driver (writing the code) and one person being the viewer and observing the coder.
It is important to stay locked in as the observer, becoming disjointed with the work is only the start
of a downward spiral that is hard to recover from. When your assignemnt is complete, it is important to
re-read the assignment one last time to make sure you hit very point and your assignemnt is 100% done.
